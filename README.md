# Mindstorms-EV3-games-and-blocks
A collection of games and function blocks I wrote for the Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick. Written back in 2020.

The kit used for this project is the [Lego Mindstorms EV3 Home Edition, Lego article number 31313](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313), but almost all programs only need the central unit, the EV3 Brick. Minesweeper requires a pressure sensor connected to port 4 to act as another button to flag tiles.
